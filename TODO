16:47 < maxauthor> bartman: I just thought about a useful feature, Alt-K would select lines one upwards, which can then be pasted to the current bash-command with enter, let me explain...
16:47 < maxauthor> $ locate test.conf ->
16:47 < maxauthor> 1
16:47 < maxauthor> 2
16:47 < maxauthor> 3
16:47 < maxauthor> 4
16:47 < maxauthor> $ vim <Alt-k><alt-k><enter> ->
16:47 < maxauthor> $ vim 3
